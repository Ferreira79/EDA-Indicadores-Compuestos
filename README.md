# Exploratory analysys: Composite Indicators

Exploratory analysis of composite indicators related to Agenda 2030 and the SDGs

The aim of this analysis is to demonstrate the possible explanation of the variability of the data in this dataset, previously created with data from all the composite indicators explained below, for the year 2019.

Linear relationship, correlation, and multicollinearity have been analyzed through an exploratory analysis. The intention of these analyses is to conclude which indicators explain the majority of the data, so that it would be possible to reduce the number of indicators when improving a country's performance in environmental, economic, and social matters. By doing so, it could be possible to extrapolate the reasoning to the operation of Agenda 2030, where the structure followed by the 293 indicators is similar to that followed by the described indicators and therefore be the first step in reducing the intrinsic effort of data collection that this agenda entails.

The chosen indicators are the following:



**EPI - Enviromental Performance Index**

**EFP – Ecological Footprint** 

**HDI – Human Development Index** 

**GDP - Gross Domestic Product**

**GPI – Global Peace Index**

**GSCI - Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index**

**HFI – Human Freedom Index**

**SPI – Social Progress Index**

**WRI - World Risk Index**
